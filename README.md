**Somethings to know:**
-The files with a "_" at the start are the important ones 
-The files with a "Z" at the start are the unimportant old files

-A chess move will contain a piece that was moved represented by one letter at the start and the square it moved to (a letter and number)
-An uppercase letter in a chess move represents a white piece and a lowercase letter represents a black piece
-If there is only the square in the chess move that means that a pawn was moved
-There is no en passant and no castling due to time pressure

**Terminology:**

Heatmap - Best locations for pieces
FEN - A string of text that represents a current chess position
PGN - A block of text that represents a full chess game
